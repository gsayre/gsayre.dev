# Hello World

Hey everyone! Just a small preface about myself. I'm a software engineer who has a passion for full-stack web development. I've been working in industry for 4.5 years now in various technologies but have always found myself coming back to the web. Whether it be an idea for some kind of tool that would make my life easier or something that could benefit a community I find myself booting up localhost:3000 to get the job done. In recent months I have found myself coming back to the same project most evenings. As someone who spends most of their free time playing volleyball; my weekends are often consumed by tournaments. Most of these tournaments have different standards for the way they are run which can cause a lot of conflict between the player and the people putting together the event for them. I'm trying to help with this by building a site that makes the experience consistent so the players know what to expect when signing up to play and the directors could sit back and focus on making their tournament the best experience possible without getting stuck in the weeds of busywork. For this blog I will be making two posts a week to share the technical difficulties and findings that I have from building this application. In this process I hope that both you and I can learn something and become a little bit better at what we love doing!
